**Hack Your Expenses!**

The problem ExpenseBit solves

While looking for a personal budgeting app, we found out that all the web apps available are 
    either too complicated to use (ex. Quikbooks, YNAB - budgeting software) or 
    there UI is not up to par for a busy life of us students. 
So we have come up with a solution to provide a web app with a UI which is simple, clean and offers the user an undistracted and effortless solution. 

Expense bit is a safe and easy to use platform for managing and logging day to day money transactions for students.
